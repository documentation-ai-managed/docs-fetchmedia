## Overview

The **FetchMedia Fetch API** allows you to programmatically fetch media from supported public URLs (for example, video platforms, social networks) and make the resulting files available for download or further processing.

This API is optimized for:

- Pulling remote media into FetchMedia without manual downloads

- Inspecting media metadata before fetching

- Asynchronous processing with webhook notifications

- Secure, time-limited downloads

All requests require API key authentication via the `X-API-KEY` header.

## Core Concepts

### Fetch

A **fetch** represents a job that retrieves media from a given URL.\
Each fetch tracks status, errors, and the resulting downloadable file.

### Asynchronous Execution

Fetching runs asynchronously:

- You receive a `fetch_id` immediately

- The job transitions through `pending → running → success | failed`

- Completion can be tracked via polling or a webhook

### Secure Downloads

Fetched files are downloaded using a `302` redirect to an expiring, signed URL.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /fetch` - [Create a Fetch](/post-fetch)

**What it does**\
Starts a new fetch for a given URL.

**How to use it**

- Submit a public media URL

- Optionally provide a webhook for completion notification

- Receive a `fetch_id` to track progress

**Common usage patterns**

- Download videos from supported platforms

- Automate content acquisition workflows

---

### `GET /fetch/metadata` - [Get Video Metadata (Query)](/get-fetch-metadata)

**What it does**\
Retrieves metadata for a media URL without fetching the file.

**How to use it**

- Preview content before fetching

- Understand media properties before fetching

- Validate URLs

- Display video details in UIs before starting a fetch

**Notes**

- Requires the `url` query parameter

- No file is downloaded

- No fetch job is created

---

### `POST /fetch/metadata` - [Get Video Metadata (Body)](/post-fetch-metadata)

**What it does**\
Same functionality as the GET variant, but accepts the URL in the request body.

**How to use it**

- Preferable when URLs are long

- Understand media properties before fetching

- Useful for JSON-only API clients

**Behavior**

- Requires the `url` in the JSON body

- No file is downloaded

- No fetch job is created

---

### `GET /fetch/{id}` - [Get Fetch Status](/get-fetch-id)

**What it does**\
Retrieves the current state and details of a fetch job.

**Returned data includes**

- Original URL

- Fetch status (`pending`, `running`, `success`, `failed`)

- Download URL (when available)

- Error message (if failed)

**How to use it**

- Poll fetch progress

- Detect completion or failure

- Retrieve the final download endpoint

---

### `GET /fetch/{id}/{filename}` - [Download Fetched File](/get-fetch-id-filename)

**What it does**\
Initiates download of the fetched media file.

**How it works**

- Returns a `302` redirect

- Redirects to a short-lived, signed download URL

**How to use it**

- Download fetched media

- Serve files to clients without proxying large payloads

- Chain into further processing steps
