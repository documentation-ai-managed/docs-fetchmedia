## Overview

The **FetchMedia Files API** provides a unified interface for ingesting, storing, downloading, and inspecting media files used across the FetchMedia platform.\
It is designed as the entry point for media files that will later be processed by commands (FFmpeg jobs) or consumed directly.

Files can be created by:

- Uploading a binary file

- Importing a publicly accessible URL

Once ingested, FetchMedia automatically probes the media using **ffprobe** to extract metadata such as duration, resolution, and format.

All requests require API key authentication via the `X-API-KEY` header.

## Core Concepts

### File

A **File** represents a single media file stored in FetchMedia.\
It includes metadata, processing status, download URL, and optional ffprobe results.

### File Lifecycle

1. File is uploaded or imported

2. File is processed and analyzed

3. Metadata becomes available

4. File can be referenced by other APIs (e.g. Commands)

5. File can be downloaded or deleted

### Secure Downloads

Files are downloaded via a **302 redirect** to a short-lived, signed URL.

## API Endpoints

### `GET /files` - [List Files](/get-files)

**What it does**\
Returns a paginated list of all uploaded or imported files.

**How to use it**

- Build media libraries

- Display file lists in dashboards

- Audit stored files

**Typical use cases**

- Fetch the latest uploaded files

- Paginate through historical files

---

### `POST /files` - [Create a File](/post-files)

**What it does**\
Creates a new file by either uploading a file or importing it from a URL.

**How it works**

- Accepts `multipart/form-data`

- You must provide **either**:

  - `file` (binary upload)

  - `file_url` (publicly accessible URL)

**Common usage patterns**

- Upload user-generated content

- Import media from external storage or CDN

- Import media from public social URLs

- Prepare files for FFmpeg processing

---

### `GET /files/{id}` - [Get File Details](/get-files-id)

**What it does**\
Retrieves metadata and processing status for a single file.

**Returned data includes**

- File name and source

- Processing status

- Download URL

- ffprobe metadata (if available)

- Error details if processing failed

**How to use it**

- Poll file readiness

- Inspect media properties before processing

- Debug ingestion issues

---

### `DELETE /files/{id}` - [Delete a File](/delete-files-id)

**What it does**\
Deletes a file by ID.

**How to use it**

- Clean up unused or temporary media

- Enforce storage limits or retention policies

**Notes**

- Deletion removes the file and associated metadata

---

### `GET /files/{id}/{filename}` - [Download a File](/get-files-id-filename)

**What it does**\
Initiates a secure download of the file.

**How it works**

- Redirects to a time-limited, signed download URL

**How to use it**

- Download processed file

- Serve files to end users via controlled redirects

- Avoid proxying large media files through your backend
