## File Naming and Aliasing

### Input Files

When referencing input media, FetchMedia **requires aliased file names**, not raw URLs or paths inside commands.
Input aliases should use the `in_` prefix followed by a numeric or descriptive suffix.

**Recommended pattern**

- `in_1`

- `in_main`

- `in_audio`

These aliases are mapped to actual file URLs or uploaded assets via the `input_files` object.\
This keeps FFmpeg commands clean, reusable, and deterministic.

---

### Output Files

Output files follow the same aliasing model using the `out_` prefix.

**Recommended pattern**

- `out_1`

- `out_final`

- `out_preview`

Output aliases are resolved using the `output_files` object and define the filenames that will be generated and stored by FetchMedia.

This approach allows multiple outputs, predictable naming, and easy chaining of commands.

## Why File Aliasing Exists

### Clean Commands, Predictable Execution

Aliasing files decouples **execution logic** from **file transport and storage**.

By separating file references from FFmpeg commands:

- Commands become reusable templates

- URLs and storage details are abstracted away

- Validation and security are centralized

- Multi-step pipelines are easier to manage

This design avoids fragile, URL-heavy command strings and ensures consistent execution across environments.

## Authentication

All FetchMedia APIs use **API key authentication**.

You must include your API key in every request using the following header:

```
--header X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here
```

Requests without a valid API key are rejected.
Authentication is required for all endpoints across Fetch, Files, and Commands.

## API Modules Overview

### Fetch API

The Fetch API pulls media from supported public URLs into FetchMedia asynchronously. It is used to ingest external content and, optionally, to inspect metadata before download.

---

### Files API

The Files API manages uploaded and imported media assets.
It handles ingestion, probing (ffprobe), secure downloads, and lifecycle management.

---

### Commands API

The Commands API executes FFmpeg-based media processing jobs.
It transforms input files into output files using templated, alias-driven commands.
