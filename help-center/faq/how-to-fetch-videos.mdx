## Overview

FetchMedia lets you fetch videos using a simple API request. Just provide the social link and your API key.

## Steps

1. Copy the social video URL (e.g., TikTok, Instagram)
2. Get your API key from the FetchMedia dashboard
3. Send a request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.fetchmedia.com/v1/fetch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \

You’ll receive the processed video or a download link in the response.
